# LEDs

## Overview
The LED is a diode, meaning current can only flow one way. From the positive to the negative.
The positive (Anode) terminal is the longer pin.
The negative (Cathode) terminal is the shorter pin.

An LED is a non-linear device meaning it requires a minimal voltage before it starts conducting.

## Finding the forward voltage
Put the multimeter on diode testing mode (―⯈⊢ Option 3 and press select twice)
The multimeter will only give a reading if the LED it connected the right way
Red probe (negative) on the anode (+ or longer pin)
