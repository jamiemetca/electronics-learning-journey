# Multimeter notes
The multimeter I'm using is an AstroAi DM6000AR TRUE-RMS

What does true rms mean?
Something to do with measuring AC current.

Makes notes (with pictures) of which settings on the device measure what.
Things to keep in mind (be careful).

## Symbols
- DC voltage V⎓ (line with 3 dashes underneith)
- AC voltage V~
- Resistance (ohms) Ω

## How to measure Voltage (DC)
The clockwise first setting (line with 3 dashes underneith) is used to measure DC voltage.
This can be used to measure the voltage drop between the negative and positive terminals of a battery.

## How to measure Capacitance
### What is capacitance?

## How to measure Duty Cycle
### What is duty cycle?
Duty cycle is the ratio of time a device or system is "on" (active) compared to the total time of a cycle, oftern expressed as a percentage.

The duration the device is delivering power.
