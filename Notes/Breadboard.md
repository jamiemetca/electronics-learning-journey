# Breadboard

## Overview
There are 2 linked areas of a breadboard
1. The rails
   - There is continuity for the full length of both positive rails
   - There is continuity for the full length of both negative rails
2. Rows
   - a-e
   - f-j

This means you will get a positive continuity test anywhere along the negative column/rail.

The same goes for anywhere from a-e on the same row and f to j on the same row.

a to b on seperate rows will not conduct.
