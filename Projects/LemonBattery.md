# Lemon battery

## Aim
To measure a voltage drop.

## Setup
- A lemon
- Two conductive metals of differing conductivity
- A multimeter

Test the two metals for continutiy.
Damage/bruise the lemon innards to help conductivity.
Insert the metals in to the lemon a couple of cms apart.

## Testing
To test the metals for continuity, put the multimeter on the continuity setting (3rd icon, circle with waves, you needs to press select to get the correct setting).

Set the multimeter to the DC voltage setting.
Place a probe on each of the metals

If successful there will be some voltage reading.

## Result
There was on observable voltage coming through the lemon.

## Thoughts
There are a few points I may have not gotted right.
I didn't damage the inside of the lemon enough.
The metals used weren't conductive enough.

## Summary
I now know how to;
- measure DC voltage
- test continuity
