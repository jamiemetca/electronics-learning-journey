Okay, that's a great goal! Transitioning from software to firmware engineering is achievable, especially with your existing software background. It requires blending your programming skills with hardware understanding.
Here is a high-level, 6-month curriculum designed to build foundational knowledge and practical skills in electronics and C for microcontrollers, keeping in mind your starting point and goals:
Core Principles Throughout:
 * Hands-On is Key: Don't just read; build, measure, program, and debug.
 * Consistency: Aim for regular, focused sessions rather than infrequent marathon sessions. Even 30-60 minutes several times a week is effective.
 * Embrace Debugging: Things often won't work the first time. Learning to troubleshoot systematically (both hardware and software) is a crucial skill.
 * Safety First: Learn basic electrical safety, especially when dealing with anything beyond low-voltage DC circuits.
Essential Tools & Resources (Acquire early):
 * Multimeter: Your primary measurement tool.
 * Breadboard & Jumper Wires: For solderless prototyping.
 * Basic Components Kit: Resistors, capacitors, LEDs, transistors, buttons, etc.
